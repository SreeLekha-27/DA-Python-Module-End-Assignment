## Final Insights (Summary)

The analysis shows that interactive content such as reels and videos generates higher engagement compared to other post types. Entertainment and educational categories receive more likes, especially in regions with strong mobile usage, indicating a mobile-first audience. User activity peaks during evening hours, which results in higher impressions and engagement during that time.
