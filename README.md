## Final Insights (Summary)

## Final Insights (Summary)

The analysis shows that interactive content such as reels and videos generates higher engagement compared to other post types. Entertainment and educational categories receive more likes, especially in regions with strong mobile usage, indicating a mobile-first audience. User activity peaks during evening hours, which results in higher impressions and engagement during that time.

User behavior analysis highlights that audiences aged 25–35 are the most engaged. Verified accounts consistently perform better than non-verified ones, showing higher trust and visibility. Mobile devices contribute the highest watch time, confirming that most users consume content primarily through smartphones.
